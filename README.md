# Complex Numbers Multiplier

The project consists of implementing an complex numbers multiplier in three ways, each with another degree of parallelism. All multiplier modules communications consist of valid-ready protocol. Alongside the multiplier modules, the project includes testbenches and monitors for each module.


## Running the tests

For testing and simulation ModelSim PE is used. In order to test the modules, the module, testbench and monitor files have to be compiled.

## Language
Altough the README.md is written in English, the project folders and documentation is written in Romanian, as a requirement for the course. The Verilog code will be written in english (variable names, parameters, comments etc.) for further use and readability.
